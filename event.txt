About Event
​Join us after work for an after-work hack with our friends at Tessl and Anthropic, where we’ll build personalised “Spotify Wrapped”-style dashboards using specs and Claude Code.

​This is a hands-on evening for developers interested in agentic workflows, autonomous software patterns, and pushing LLMs beyond prompts into structured, repeatable development.

​What we’ll do
​In a focused 2-hour hack, you’ll:

​Choose one or two data sources (APIs, exports, or personal data)

​Write specs to guide Claude to extract, process, and visualise insights

​Build your own “year-in-review” dashboard

​Think Spotify Wrapped, but for anything: GitHub, fitness, browser usage, Claude activity, email patterns, gaming stats, and more.

​The goal is simple: the best specifications win. Code quality is secondary. This is about instructing AI effectively and building reproducible AI-native workflows.

​What you’ll need
​A laptop

​Access to one or two data sources you’d like to explore

​Curiosity and a willingness to experiment

​Schedule
​19:00-19:15 — Intro to spec-driven development (Simon Maple, Head of DevRel at Tessl)
19:15-19:30 — How to guide Claude Code effectively (Adriaan Engelbrecht, Applied AI at Anthropic)
19:30-21:30 — Hacking session
21:30-22:00 — Demos and judging

​What You’ll Get
​​Hands-on time with Tessl’s spec-driven dev platform

​​Access to Claude Code and workflow integration opportunities

​​Pizza, drinks, and swag to fuel your build

​Apply to join and build your own “Wrapped” from scratch.
